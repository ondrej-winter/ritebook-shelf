# Agnostic Skill Catalog Reference

Use this reference after the main routing guide when a task needs lifecycle
composition guidance or a full catalog scan.

Dependency entries in the catalog use `relationship: route`; they advertise
available destinations rather than activating all listed skills. A task should
activate only the workflows whose own triggers are present. Other skill-to-skill
relationships are classified as `handoff`, `verification`, or `awareness` in the
owning skill metadata.

## Conditional Lifecycle Composition

There is no universal ordered lifecycle. Compose only the branches whose triggers
are present, and let each routed skill's narrower activation rules override this
summary. A complete feature can move through this graph:

```
Clarify only when needed
  unclear intent -> interview-me
  rough or undecided concept -> idea-refine

Define only when requirements need durable agreement
  incomplete, conflicting, or scattered requirements -> spec-driven-development
  precise fix or small edit with clear acceptance criteria -> continue from request

Plan when the work benefits from decomposition
  planning-and-task-breakdown -> optional review-implementation-plan

Prepare according to the task's evidence needs
  missing context -> context-engineering
  source-sensitive decision -> source-driven-development
  high-stakes or unfamiliar decision -> doubt-driven-development in-flight

Implement
  multi-file or non-minimal work -> incremental-implementation
    for each behavior slice that automated tests can verify:
      test-driven-development RED -> smallest implementation -> GREEN -> REFACTOR -> verify
    for non-behavioral slices:
      edit -> relevant parser, schema, lint, build, or review check
  minimal testable behavior change -> test-driven-development directly
  apply specialized architecture, UI, API, security, or performance workflows only when triggered

Review and ship only as needed
  focused review -> code-review-and-quality
  unnecessary complexity -> code-simplification
  project documentation or durable decisions -> documentation-and-adrs
  version-control, CI/CD, migration, or release work -> the matching shipping workflow
```

`test-driven-development` is not a phase after implementation. When activated, its
RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle governs the implementation portion of each relevant
slice. A focused bug fix might use `debugging-and-error-recovery` to reproduce and
localize the failure, then use TDD inside the smallest fix slice before review.
