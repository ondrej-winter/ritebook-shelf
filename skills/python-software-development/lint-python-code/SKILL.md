# Lint Python Code

Use this skill when a Python project is configured to run `ruff` for linting and
`mypy` for static type checking through `uv`.

## Prerequisites

- `uv` is installed and configured for the project.
- `ruff` and `mypy` are installed as development dependencies.
- The project includes configuration for `ruff` and `mypy`, such as in
  `pyproject.toml` or tool-specific configuration files.

## Steps

### 1. Run ruff linting

```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

This command checks for linting errors without applying auto-fixes.

### 2. Run mypy type checking

```bash
uv run mypy .
```

This command performs static type checking on the Python codebase.

If the project defines narrower package, source, or test paths, use those paths in
place of `.` while preserving the same tools and project configuration.

## When linting or type checking fails

- Read the `ruff check` output carefully. Each violation includes a rule code, file path, and line number. Fix the underlying code rather than adding `# noqa` comments unless the suppression is explicitly justified.
- Do not disable lint rules to silence violations. Prefer refactoring the code to satisfy the rule.
- Read `mypy` errors and fix the type annotations or logic that caused them. Use `# type: ignore[<code>]` only at narrowly scoped boundaries to genuinely untyped third-party code, and document the reason.
- If a `mypy` error reflects a genuine design issue (wrong return type, missing protocol method), fix the design rather than suppressing the error.
- After fixes, re-run both commands to confirm the codebase is clean before proceeding.
